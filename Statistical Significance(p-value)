For a universe with null hypothesis, we perform an experiment with the assumption that the experiment is fair and calculate the probability of the the current event.

If the probability of the event (coin flip with continuous smae output) drops significantly:

We say that the p-value is so small that it is justified that the universe is not fair.

We have to put it in mathematical terms where we set a threshold value on the probability of the event and we reject the hypothesis and declare that the universe is not fair.
