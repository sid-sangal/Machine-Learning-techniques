Multiple Lin Reg is a modification of simple Lin Reg where the number of dependent variables is more than one. Thus the RHS of the line equation has multiple 'x' terms.

y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2.... + bn*xn

We haev multiple features and we are trying to find the corellation between the y and all x variables.

We have the example of the profit data based on various expenses.
We will have to perform encoding for categorical variables.
We will create a dummy variable based on the number of categories. For the current example we haev California and NewYork. We will have 1 bit with 0/1 representation. Like a switch

for 3 numeric features and 1 ategorical data:
y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + b3*x3 + b4*D1
