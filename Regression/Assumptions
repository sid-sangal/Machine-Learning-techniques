The assumptions are as following:

1. Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.

2. Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.

3. Multivariate normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.

4. Independence of errors: Observations are independent of each other.

5. Lack of multicollinearity
