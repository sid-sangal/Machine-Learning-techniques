The contents of this repository are a combination of many tools such as the Udemy Course named ML A-Z, Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew NG and some useful interview prep books
such as 1. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2. Cracking the Machine Learning interview and other resources will be added as the repo grows.

The intention behind creating this repo is for it to be a roadmap for anyone who wants to fall deeper into this never ending pit of AI and what many(including me) believe to be the 
future of Computer Science with the advent of growing data.

This repository is a compilation of fundamental Machine Learning techniques which will be updated on a regular basis

1. Data preprocessing
2. Linear regression
3. Polynomial regression
4. Support Vector
5. Decision tree
6. Random forest
7. Logistic regression
8. KNN
9. SVM
10. Kernel SVM
11. Naive Bayes
12. Deision Tree Classification
13. Random forest
14. K-means clustering
17. Hierarchical clustering

The other folders in this repository are named after the major types of machine learning techniques and contatin an implementatio nad understanding of the same.

1. Refinforcement learning(RL): UCB & Thompson Sampling
2. Natural Language Processing(NLP)
3. Deep Learning: Neural Nets, CNN
4. Dimensionality reduction: PCA,LDA,Kernel LDA
5. Boosting: Adaboost, XG Boost
